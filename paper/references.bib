abstract = {Despite the recognized potential of multiprocessing little is known concerning the general problem of finding efficient algorithms which compute minimallength schedules for given computations and m 2 processors. In this paper we formulate a general model of computation structures and exhibit an efficient algorithm for finding optimal nonpreemptive schedules for these structures on two-processor systems. We prove that the algorithm gives optimal solutions and discuss its application to preemptive scheduling disciplines.},
